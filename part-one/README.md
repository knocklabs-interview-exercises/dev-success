# Part one: Javascript Katas (30 minutes)

In this part of the interview, we'll be running through some JS exercises. There are 4 functions
to implement in total in the `index.js` file. The `index.test.js` file has a test suite that we
want to make pass.

Each function has a comment block above in the `index.js` file describing the functionality we wish
to implement. Take care to handle all requirements.

## Getting started

Run `npm install`

## Running the test suite

`npm run test`

## Running an individual test

You can run an individual test by running `npm run test:{name}` where `name` is one of `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`.
